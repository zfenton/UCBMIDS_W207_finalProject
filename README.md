__Final Project__

_The goal of the project is to perform an end to end dataset analysis (data cleaning, model training, hyperparameter selection, model evaluation).</br>
You can select a dataset for your project by browsing:</br>_
- The UCI Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php</br>
- Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com</br>

_Ensure that the dataset you sourced does not contain personal identifiable information and is not a synthetic dataset. Make sure you understand how the dataset was collected (e.g. is it scraped from the web? Is it based on human or automatic annotation?)</br>
For the final project you will form a group of 3 or 4 people. Your group can only include members from the section in which you are enrolled. You will pick your own dataset (each group should have a different dataset). You will present your final project in class during the final session (for ~ 15 min).</br>
